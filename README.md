# NamasteReact
My repo for react practise

#Redux
-install @reduxjs/toolkit and react-redux
-build store
-connect store to app
-create slices inside store based on logic
-dispach action when we click/perform action
-create selector and subscribe

//redux performance optimization
-subscribe to specific/small portion only
-while creating appStore it has one reducer - combination of multiple small reducers
-while creating slice it has reducers
//vanilla/older redux
-dont mutate state
